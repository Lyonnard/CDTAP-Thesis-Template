\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}
One or two pages of very touchy words mixed to bad jokes where you thank your supervisors, colleagues, friends, and family for their support during the thesis writing (if they had contacts with you at the time of writing they deserve your gratitude, trust me!)
